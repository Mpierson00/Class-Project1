#Beginner HTML Refactor Landing Page

##This project is a beginner level refactor of a HTML landing page. I completed this project to practice refactoring a HTML landing page to better my understanding of the process that goes into it.

##To view the landing page and refactor, simply open the 'index.html' file in your web browser. You can also go to 'https://mpierson00.github.io/Class-Project1/' to view the landing page.

##Credit goes to UNC Chapel Hill Coding BootCamp and https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide.
